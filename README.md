silverstripe-booking
====================

An accommodation booking system, which implements silverstripe-omnipay for credit card payments through DPS (Payment Express) - could easily be extended to use for appointments (hairdressing etc) or used to sell single products, one by one, without the implementation of a shopping cart system.

## Requirements
- SilverStripe 3.1.X
